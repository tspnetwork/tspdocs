weight: 2
---

dApps in TSP are uniquely positioned as bots, such as those built on top of the popular [Telegram Bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots), and we are using TSP APIs and SDKs to empower dApps' capabilities as in-chat agents. 

These TSP dApps are working like in-chat agents, which can

1. automate workflow such as ordering goods/services or tokens
2. facilitate chat group based social engagement, such as air-dropping tokens to your qualified followers' accounts
3. AI/LLM-enabled agents to automate any knowledge-based conversations or workflow
4. And many many more

```
Only the sky is the limit!
