## Solidity Interface & ABI

ICS20.sol - previously known as IBCTransfer.sol - is an interface through which Solidity contracts can interact with the IBC protocol on TSP chain. This is convenient for developers as they donâ€™t need to know the implementation details behind the transfer module in IBC-go. Instead, they can perform IBC transfers using the Ethereum interface they are familiar with. An example of a simple implementation can be found in the `tspchain/extensions` repo.

**Interface `ICS20.sol`**

## Transactions

- `approve`
  
  ```
    /// @dev Approves IBC transfer with a specific amount of tokens.
    /// @param spender spender The address which will spend the funds.
    /// @param allocations The allocations for the authorization.
    function approve(
        address spender,
        Allocation[] calldata allocations
    ) external returns (bool approved);
  ```
  
- `revoke`
  
  ```
    /// @dev Revokes IBC transfer authorization for a specific spender
    /// @param spender The address which will spend the funds.
    function revoke(address spender) external returns (bool revoked);
  ```
  

`increaseAllowance`

```
    /// @dev Increase the allowance of a given spender by a specific amount of tokens and IBC connection for IBC transfer methods.
    /// @param spender The address which will spend the funds.
    /// @param sourcePort The source port of the IBC transaction.
    /// @param sourceChannel The source channel of the IBC transaction.
    /// @param denom The denomination of the tokens transferred.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens to be spent.
    function increaseAllowance(
        address spender,
        string calldata sourcePort,
        string calldata sourceChannel,

## Queries

- `denomTrace`
  
  ```
    /// @dev DenomTrace defines a method for returning a denom trace.
    function denomTrace(
        string memory hash
    ) external returns (DenomTrace memory denomTrace);

`denomHash`

```
    /// @dev DenomHash defines a method for returning a hash of the denomination trace info.
    function denomHash(

```

`allowance`

```
/// @dev Returns the remaining number of tokens that spender will be allowed to spend on behalf of owner through/// IBC transfers. This is an empty array by default./// @param owner The address of the account owning tokens./// @param spender The address of the account able to transfer the tokens./// @return allocations The remaining amounts allowed to spend for/// corresponding source port and channel.function allowance(    address owner,    address spender) external view returns (Allocation[] memory allocations);

## Events

Each of the transactions emits its corresponding event. These are:

- `IBCTransfer`
  
  ```

    /// @param sourceChannel The source channel of the IBC transaction.
    /// @param denom The denomination of the tokens transferred.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens transferred.
    /// @param memo The IBC transaction memo.
    event IBCTransfer(
        address indexed sender,
        string indexed receiver,
        string sourcePort,
        string sourceChannel,
        string denom,
        uint256 amount,
        string memo
    );
  ```
