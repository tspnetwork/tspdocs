## Solidity Interface & ABI

`Distribution.sol` is an interface through which Solidity contracts can interact with Cosmos SDK distribution.
This is convenient for developers as they donâ€™t need to know the implementation details behind
the `x/distribution` module in the Cosmos SDK. Instead,
they can interact with distribution functions using the Ethereum interface they are familiar with.

### Interface `Distribution.sol`

Find the [Solidity interface in the `tspchain/extensions` repo](https://github.com/tspnetwork/tspchain/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/stateful/Distribution.sol).

### ABI
`
Find the [ABI in the `tspchain/extensions` repo](https://github.com/tspnetwork/tspchain/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/abi/distribution.json).

`delegatorWithdrawAddress`

`delegatorWithdrawAddress` queries withdraw address of a delegator

```
    /// @dev Queries the address capable of withdrawing rewards for a given delegator.
    /// @param delegatorAddress The address of the delegator
    /// @return withdrawAddress The address capable of withdrawing rewards for the delegator.
    function delegatorWithdrawAddress(
        address delegatorAddress
    ) external view returns (string memory withdrawAddress);
```

## Events

Each of the transactions emits its corresponding event. These are:

- `SetWithdrawerAddress`
  
  ```
    /// @dev SetWithdrawerAddress defines an Event emitted when a new withdrawer address is being set
    /// @param caller the caller of the transaction
    /// @param withdrawerAddress the newly set withdrawer address
    event SetWithdrawerAddress(
        address indexed caller,
        string withdrawerAddress
    );
  ```
  

`WithdrawDelegatorRewards`

```
    /// @dev WithdrawDelegatorRewards defines an Event emitted when rewards from a delegation are withdrawn
    /// @param delegatorAddress the address of the delegator
    /// @param validatorAddress the address of the validator
    /// @param amount the amount being withdrawn from the delegation
    event WithdrawDelegatorRewards(
        address indexed delegatorAddress,
        string indexed validatorAddress,
        uint256 amount
    );
```

`WithdrawValidatorCommission`

```
    /// @dev WithdrawValidatorCommission defines an Event emitted when validator commissions are being withdrawn
    /// @param validatorAddress is the address of the validator
    /// @param commission is the total commission earned by the validator
    event WithdrawValidatorCommission(
        string indexed validatorAddress,
        uint256 commission
    );
```

## Interact with the Solidity Interface

Below are some examples of how to interact with this Solidity interface from your smart contracts.

Make sure to import the precompiled interface, e.g.:

```
import "https://github.com/tspnetwork/tspchain/extensions/blob/main/precompiles/stateful/Distribution.sol";
```

### Set withdraw address

The `changeWithdrawAddress` function allows a user to set a new withdraw address in the Cosmos `x/distribution` module.
For this transaction to be successful, make sure the user had already approved the `MSG_SET_WITHDRAWER_ADDRESS` message.

```
    function changeWithdrawAddress(
        string memory _withdrawAddr
    ) public returns (bool) {
        return
            distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.setWithdrawAddress(
                msg.sender,
                _withdrawAddr
            );
    }
```

### Withdraw staking rewards

The `withdrawStakingRewards` function allows a user to withdraw his/her rewards corresponding to a specified validator.
For this transaction to be successful, make sure the user had already approved the `MSG_WITHDRAW_DELEGATOR_REWARD` message.

```
    function withdrawStakingRewards(
        string memory _valAddr
    ) public returns (types.Coin[] memory) {
        return
            distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.withdrawDelegatorRewards(
                msg.sender,
                _valAddr
            );
    }
```

### Withdraw validator commission

If the user is running a validator, he/she could withdraw the corresponding commission using a smart contract.
The user could use a function similar to `withdrawCommission`.
For this transaction to be successful,
make sure the user had already approved the `MSG_WITHDRAW_VALIDATOR_COMMISSION` message.

```
function withdrawCommission(
    string memory _valAddr
) public returns (types.Coin[] memory) {
    return
        distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.withdrawValidatorCommission(
            _valAddr
        );
}
```

### Queries

Similarly to transactions, smart contracts can use query methods. These are read-only methods.
Examples of this are the `getDelegationRewards` and `getValidatorCommision` functions that return the information for the specified validator address.

```
getDelegationRewards(
    string memory _valAddr
) public view returns (types.DecCoin[] memory) {
    return
        distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.delegationRewards(
            msg.sender,
            _valAddr
        );
}

function getValidatorCommission(
    string memory _valAddr
) public view returns (types.DecCoin[] memory) {
    return distribution.DISTRIBUTION_CONTRACT.validatorCommission(_valAddr);
}
```
